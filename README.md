> Tic Tac Toe is a game whereby if you get three X’s or O’s in a row you win.  This was my first project and my first ever attempt a building an online line, so I chose to go with what would be considered the ‘beginner-friendly’ two-player version of the game to help consolidate my learning from the first two weeks of the software engineering immersive course.

> The source code can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/HelenevB/SEI-Project01-Tic-Tac-Toe)

> If you want to try playing the game, you can access the deployed version [here](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/hvb/Project-One-Tic-Tac-Toe/)

#### The Brief & Timeframe

* This was a solo project 
* Timeframe: 7 days 

#### Technologies used
