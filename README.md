### Background  to the project 

#### Concept of Tic Tac Toe & Ideas for the Game 

##### Tic Tac Toe is a Two Player Game whereby if you get three X's or O's in  row you win . I wanted to create a Two Player version of the game that allowed for personalizations (name input and character selection) and allow for accumalative score count between two players over multiple games (or a complete restart.  Although some of these functions are now considered on-going enhancements.

#### Development Process 

I considered  4 key elements for the game :

* Start Function & game set up 
* playing the Game
* Determining the Winner 
* Restarting or refreshing the page
